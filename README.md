# Plantwaterer 3000

Everyone knows it, when you once again forget to water one of your plants. For this to never happen again, we have created this small project. It's an automated plant-waterer.

The goal of this arduino-machine is to automatically water the plant, whenever it is in need of moisturization. The plant's owner is indicated by various LED's, what the level of the  moisture in the plants soil is.
This is not everything it does. There is also another LED that shows if the owner should fill up the watertank, if the water is running low.
