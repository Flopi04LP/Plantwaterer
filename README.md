# Plantwaterer 3000

Everyone knows it, when you once again forget to water your one of your plants. For this to never happen again, we have created this arduino-project. An automated plant-waterer.

The goal of this machine is to automatically water the plant, whenever it is in need of moisturization. The owner of the plant gets indicated by various LED's, what the moisture of the plants soil is. 
This is not everything it does! There is also another LED that shows, if the watertank is starting to run out of water and the plant-owner should fill it up.
